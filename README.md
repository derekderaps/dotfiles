# Home directory configuration files

## Instructions
- Symlink each file to your user's home directory or appropriate subdirector
- Exceptions
  - The iTerm2 settings file, com.googlecode.iterm2.plist, can live anywhere but must be referenced in the iTerm2 application settings
  - Don't symlink .bash_profile.inc/example.github-api-token.sh. Instead, copy it to the appropriate subdirectory and insert your actual token
